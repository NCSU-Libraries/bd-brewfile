# bd-brewfile

This `Brewfile` in this repository was generated from NC State University Libraries' born-digital processing workstation. We use Homebrew to manage the majority of the applications we use in our work. This file can be used on Mac OS and Linux to quickly install a set of packages we find useful for digital archival extracting and reporting procedures.

## Install packages from a Brewfile

Assuming [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) is installed on your computer, download the Brewfile from this repository and run

`brew bundle --file=/path/to/Brewfile`

updating "/path/to/file" to where you have the Brewfile saved locally.

This Brewfile is likely to change over time. It is self-documenting.

## Helpful background

The article [macOS migrations with Brewfile](https://openfolder.sh/macos-migrations-with-brewfile) provides a useful overview of of the `bundle` Homebrew package, used in generating and installing packages through referencing Brewfiles. It also goes into some detail about Homebrew, more generally.
